of Bushire and a dependant on our Government 
in his own harbour and taken possession 
session

of her Cargo_ as soon as we received
this intelligence it appeared to us most extraordinary 
that His Highness should commit
such an action as till now has never been perpetrated 
by any individual, and we felt astonished 
that this person should do a thing
the results of which must be shame and repentance_ 
If you were acquinted with this
affair it was not proper that with all the friendship 
and affection we bear towards you, you
should permit it to take place as it is contrary
to the friendly connection existing between
the two Governments_ When Mr. Bruce began
his machinations we would not permit him 
to remian in Bushire_ as you were adorned
with the qualities of wisdom and sense, and
free from base and ignoble feelings, and a 
firm well-wisher of both Governments we
approved of you, that the established rules
might meet with no interruption_ If you
were not aware of this business how is it
that you have hitherto rendered no assistance, 
and have not retaken the Ship-/-
which as a well wisher to both Government
you ought to have done before it was brought
to our notice_ We have now informed you

her up to Shaik Mohumed Khan, from

it to us. We will not listen to any excuse
from you._ This Service (the non-performance 
of which will be attended with serious 
consequences.) is what we wish from
you, lest it be the cause of the displeasure 
of the Governments_ We have directed His
Excellency Zekee Khan to write to you on

Translation of a Letter from Zaqee Khan
Prime Minister of Fars to Coll. Stannus
no date_ received 9th. August 1826.
A.C._
Altho' by the Grace of God
we cemented the bond of friendship of Old
yet I trust that it will remain fixed generation 
after generation in this World, for
the Sole wish of the Servants of the two
mighty Governments is the faithful service, 
and regard for the interests of their 
benefactors_ It is fully evident and apparent 
that the former Resident Mr.
Bruce was not allowed to remain in his
situation and that an Order for his removal  
arrived as soon as the Members
of the two Governments were aware of the perverseness 
of his disposition in consequence 
of his acting repugnantly to the friendship
existing between the two eternal Kingdoms
When you came up you acted in an opposite 
manner to Mr. Bruce. and it was as
clear as the Sun Shining in the heavens that
your conduct was the contrary of the behaviour 
of that the former individual on this account
it was that your regard and affection gained 
all hearts and that your praiseworthy and 
agreeable qualities were approved of by every
one, and your whole line of conduct appeared
to be that of a well wisher to both Governments


13
and from this also it was that I entertained 
so sincere a regard for you till I had
the pleasure for personal interview when in
the language of the Poet. " When I beheld
you I found you a thousand times Superior
to what I had heard" and then it was that
I plighted that friendship in which I shall 
remain constant as long as I live, but in this
and every other affair certain conditions are
necessary to be observed that it be permanent
and lasting as it has been said formerly,
that nothing ought to interrupt the friendly
connection of two Governments, and that neither
party should act in a manner to afflict the
other by which means a breach in the regard
of the higher powers and a rupture in the friendShip 
of their Ministers would be avoided_
you of course are aware of the obedience and
faithful Service displayed to the Government
of Shiraz by Shaik Abdool Russool, is it then
possible that we should hear that such
an affair should have taken place in the
absence of this loyal and trusty dependant
and that it had not been rectified tho' even
at the expence of a hundred thousand lives or
any other sacrifice? _ Intelligence has just been received 
that the Ship Nusrut Shah on her way
from Calcutta experienced such treatment in 
the Cove of Muscat as to this day has never been 
before


14
before heard of from the lowest or most ignorant 
of mankind who would not have
acted in the same manner in their own residence 
to their most deadly enemy._ His Highness 
the Imam has seized Shaik Abdool Russools 
Vessel and having landed that portion
of the Cargo belonging to him has sent up the
remainder belonging to the Merchants of Bushire 
in the ship to that place._ O my Superior, 
reflect a little whether such conduct is
the act of wise man. _ To whom does the wealth
and Property of the Durrya Beg belong
otherwise than the King? whose Servant or
dependant is he? where is he now? and in 
what employment is he engaged? who has
sent him and for what purpose? his purpose 
was the house of that God in whose
unity all sects are agreed. Is His Highness
the Imam the well wisher of this Governt 
or not? if he is a friend of the Prince -/-
wherefore does he seize the property of a subject, 
like Shaik Abdool Russool who has been
ordered to a distant country not merely in
the neighbourhood but in the very entrance
of Muscat. Such an act in Persia would be
committed only by the Bukhtyaries or Mumasanies 
who plunder the Caravans, even
they however should the Property and its owner 
be in the residence or its neighbourhood
would


15
would rather show protection than molestation
tho they would make no scruple of seizing such
if they fell in with it a Kotal or road._ From 
the period that our friendship and acquaintance 
commenced to the present moment no 
such occurance as this has taken place_ It is
an affair of such serious aspect as to threaten
the destination of all friendships, and affection 
besides producing confusion. God protect 
us_ if every particle of this property is not
returned and the King informed of the same
it is quite impossible that His Majesty will
let the business drop._ I foresee that Muscat
and its foundations will be overturned like the
bubbles in the face of the Water and that the
web of the spider will be visible in that country 
do not look upon this lightly, but write to the
Imam in the most decided and peremptory
manner and recommend him not to play with
the tail of a Tiger, at the same time informing
him that he is acting in a manner that will
not only produce confusion and disorder 
there, but will be the means of distroying 
his Tribes_ His Highness the Prince has
sent for Ally Akbar and desired him to
write a similar letter to this to you, and has
specially dispactched his confidential servant 
Mohamed Ismail Beg on this affair 
to beg that you will get back the
Nusrut Shah and deliver her over to the 
People


16
People of Shaik Mohumed Khan _ if you
think proper do so; but no excuse will be listened 
to_ write also to desire that the property 
belonging to the Shaik may be given
up along with that of the Merchants. I have
entrusted
Ismail Beg with some communications 
to deliver you personally and
have told him to remain in your Residence till
this business is terminated. My dear Friend
and Master you know well that both here
and in the Kings presence, I shall be mad
answerable for this affair and that it will
be productive of serious inconvenience to 
me as my brother the Durrya Beg entrusted 
all his family friends Property and dependants 
to my care. His Highness the Prince
now requires performance of this thing from 
you and myself without fail, he has place
it in your hands and will receive no excuse
I write to you now as a friend that if this
property is not given up to the last fraction 
the friendship existing between us
will be distroyed _ If Saeed Soid has not
felt assured of you he would not have 
perpetrated this thing._ By the Unity of
God, by the unity of God, by the Soul of the
Chief of Martys I swear, that this property
shall not be kept._ My Brother do not allow
the heart of the Prince to be changed towards
the Imam, as he will then reap shame and


17
I know not how it can be rectified. I feel assured from
such conduct he will gain nothing but bitterness
Finally neither the Prince nor myself will listen
to any excuse from you._ It is necessary that
you get back the ship with the whole of the Cargo 
and deliver it over to Shaik Mohamed Khan
and send his receipt to me._

I have the honor to inform you
A.C.
that in the morning of the 3rd. Augt. the Prime
Minister sent a man to me to desire my attendance_
after paying my respects he observed, that
intelligence had just arrived that His Highness
Saeed Soid had seized the Ship Nusrut Shah
belonging to the Shaik and having returned
the Cargo had taken possession of the Vessel 
(adding) it is evident that Saeed Sodi would
not have ventured to commit such a serious
act unless by the connivance and assistance of
the Resident on account of his displeasure
towards the Shaik _ As the time the Ambassador 
was here every kind of annoyance
and displeasure between the Resident and
Shaik was completely done away with after
this


18
this the committing such an action, shutting
his Eyes to the friendship of the two Governts.
and the afflicting a friend like myself who
for years had firmly connected the bond of
love and affection could produce no other
fruit than repentance_ as the high in place
Mr. Bruce, by acting in this foolish manner
fell from the situation of honor._As a friend
I had hoped that the instant he (the Resident)
had become acquainted with these
circumstances he would without any intimation 
from us have forbidden and prevented 
His Highness Saeed Soid from doing this bad
action and considering that the Resident
is always requiring the performance of some
urgent affair from this mighty Government
what could possibly have been better or
more proper than so doing_ (The Minister then
concluded) by desiring me to write what had
taken place saying that he would prepare a
full exposition and send it, by the respectable 
Ismail Beg, to this added that the Shaik
is a Servant of the Prince's Government consequently 
all his property belongs to it and
this kind of conduct is contrary to rule and
custom_ I was afterwards taken to the
presence of H.H. the Prince who repeated
a summary of the above. I represented that 
it was utterly impossible that the Resident 
could


19
could act thus _ and that it was quite evident
that enmity or malignity towards any individual 
could not be agreeable to him for instance
with regard to the quarrel between the Shaik
and Jumal Khan he felt much regret, and repeatedly 
observed that both parties had departed
from the rules and customs of wisdom and justice 
and that besides spilling the blood of Gods
Servants (the dispute) would yield no other
fruits _ The Resident has been and is now
doing all he possibly can to settle these unexpected 
affairs_ His Highness then desired 
me to inform you of what he had said and
that he was desirous that you should settle and
finish this business adding that it appeared
to him that Saeed Soid had perpetrated this
thing by your suggestion and assistance-
In that place by the orders of the Prime
Minister I was obliged to write this letter
and deliver it to him in order that it might
be sent with his own communications. I
wish you to understand from this that
I should not have ventured to addruss in
this letter to you of myself tho' I thought
that if I refused to comply with the Khan's
desire that his suspicion would be confirmed.

refutation of so absurd a charge as that which

exonerate me in the opinion of Government

Imam to the capture of the Shipping or property 
of the Shaikh of Bushire, which so
far from being desirable, has been ever most
sincerely deprecated by me, certainly not
from any attachment to the local Government.

with regard to it and as threatening to disturb 
the general system of tranquillity._ 
But, altho' I can scarcely entertain 
3
a doubt that the propriety of my refraning
from any interference in the
present quarrel will be fully admitted by
the Government of Bombay, it will be difficult 
for me without their support to
impress upon the prejudiced and arbitrary 
administration at Shiraz a conviction
of my having been actuated by a sense of
duty or justice in declining to act in acquiescence


22
of their wishes_ It is evident that
I have already become obnoxious to His Royal
Highness and his Minister, and it is to be
apprehended that the usual petty annoyance
will be revived and sanctioned in retaliation
for what they affect to consider, my unfriendly
proceedings towards them_ I trust therefore
it may not be too unreasonable to hope, that
should I be found to have adhered implicitly 
to the spirit of my instructions, that the
sentiments of the Hon'ble the Governor in Council
regarding any conduct will be communicated
to the Persian Government, and that the Style of 
intimidation exhibited in the accompanying letters, 
as well as the doctrine which is there advanced 
respecting the duties of the Resident
and his dependance on the Prince of Shiraz.
will be noticed by Government on such terms
as will protect their agent from being in future
insulted by similar Communications_
In my reply to His Royal

I have received the letter which
you did me the honor to address to me on the subject

Imam of Muscat, and Shaik Abdool Russool
Khan Governor of Bushire, which letter has 
been accompanied by a communication from
Mirza Ally Akhbar written by your orders  and
consequently expressive of your sentiments on
this matter_ I had flattered myself that the 
unreserved sentiments which I have always
expressed on similar subjects, and which, I
will be bold to say, have never been contradicted 
by my actions, would have prevented my
conduct on this occasion from being so totally
misinterpreted, as it would appear to be, both
by yourself and His Royal Highness, but as
those declarations have been so unaccountably



24
misunderstood I once more beg to repeat, that
until I receive instructions to the contrary
from Bombay, I must continue to consider 
the British Government, as intirely
neutral in the present quarrel, and to add,
that I cannot presume to control the Ima
of Muscat in the exercise of his rights as an
independent Prince, nor to employ the Services 
of the naval force under my orders,
for any other purpose than that of carrying
into effect the Salutary Stipulations of the
treaty between the British Government

as your letter, and that written by Mirza
Ally Akbar particularly, insinuates, wilfully
tended to disturb the good understanding

aim in the discharge of the duties with which
I am intrusted to act, uprightly and impartially

I have been honored with

together with a letter from Zekee Khan and
an other written conformably to your express 
orders, by the agent of the English
Government at Shiraz, respecting the late
proceedings of the Imam of Muscat relative
to the Ship Nassret Shah; and cannot but
feel both surprised and grieved as the light
in which my conduct has been viewed by
your Royal Highness_ The sentiments
expressed by your Royal Highness have 
doubtless originated in false representations 
but I can never cease to lament that
your Royal Highness should have admitted 
suspicions so injurious to my character
without further proof than the suggestions
of


26
such interested Statements_ It is peculiarly 
distressing to me that my duty on this
occasion should be at variance with the
anxiety which I shall always feel to meet
the wishes of your Royal Highness, but
in such an alternative there can be room
for hesitation, and I can only regret my inability 
to comply with the request which
your Royal Highness has made respecting
my interference with the free agency of the
Imam of Muscat, over whose actions the
British Government possesses no control_
It is my intention to send
an immediate report to Bombay on the
subject of the disapprobation which your
Royal Highness has thought proper to express
of my conduct in this business, and to submit 
a justification thereof to the Authority to
which I am solely responsible for my actions
here, Should your Royal Highness conceive
it necessary to forward any representations on
the subject I shall take care that they shall 
be transmitted by the same opportunity,
and shall delay the departure of the Ship

Sir,
With reference to my Despatch 
No.44 in this Department, reporting
the ulterior destination of the Imam's Squadron,
and the measures which I had taken to prevent
its arrival in the Bussorah River from being
followed by an immediate rupture with
that Government, I have now the honor to forward 
a Copy of a Letter from Captain Taylor
acknowledging the receipt of my communication 
and expressing his intention of complying 
with my suggestions on the above
subject._
I beg to add that the Squadron
in question sailed from hence the 8th. Instant
and proceeded to complete its water at the
Island of Corgo from whence it is supposed
to have sailed for Bussorah this morning_

Political Department.
To;
Lt. Coll. Stannus C.B.
Resident,
Bushire
Sir,
I have the honor to
acknowledge the receipt of your letter of 29th. Ult.
conveying an intimation from the Imam of
Muscat that his fleet has been directed to proceed 
to Bussora for the purpose of communicating 
with the people of that Place on the
subject of certain pecuniary claims._
I have communicated the
substance of your letter to the Mutesellim, and
am preparing a despatch on the subject to H.
H. the Pacha; of the favorable result of which
I have the less hope from the failure of my
exertions in this cause during the past year._
The Turkish Authorities affect a high opinion
of their own power and profess very contrary
motives both of the energy and firmness of 
their apponent. Their fleet too has been for
some time preparing for resistance in some
quarter; and moreover some days ago a
Chocadar left this City for Baghdad with
despatches intimating the probablity of the
events which the receipts of your letter has confirmed; 
and may return in twenty days._
Neither


29


the people or Government
of this place have the slightest conception of
our instigation of cooperation with the Imam
in the present case, more particularly as the
favorable state of my negotiations with H.H.
the Pacha on the subject of the late irregular
and offensive conduct of the Mutesellim is
generally understood and appreciated._
The reply of the Mutesellim is
that he has no doubt that something satisfactory 
may be arranged, as to the future payments
of his demands of the yearly grant; as to the past
arrears he cannot speak; and with regard to
Hajee Naaman's debt he is not without hopes.
This reply however as coming from an inferior
can but little be depended on._
No exertion shall be wanting on
my part to induce H.H. the Pacha to consider
and attend with promptitude to the pacific 
arguments proposed in your communication._
I have the honor to be, 
Sir,
Your Obedient Servant;

Chief Secretary to Government

Sir,
I have the honor to announce
my intention of proceeding early in next month
on a Tour to the Arab Coast, which I am anxious 
to accomplish before the commencement
of the winter season as all communication
with the shore becomes difficult and uncertain
during that tempestuous period_ an early
visit is moreover desirable from considerations 
of a different tho' not less important nature, 
the most prominent of which, are the
difference


32
difference between the Shaiks Tanoon and
Abdoola ben Ahmed, the situation of the
latter with regard to Rahma ben Jaber, and
the disturbances occasioned by the reestablishment 
of the Sooedan Tribe at Derah
which has been lately rebuilt and occupied by
Salmene ben Nasser, who is engaged in fresh
hostilities with the people of Debaye._
Under the circumstances which
2.
I had the honor to report in my Despatch
N.47 in this Department, my temporary 
absence from Bushire may also prove beneficial, 
by obviating all danger of further
irritation on the subject of the Imam's proceedings_ 
While I reamin here it is probable 
that every fresh aggression of His
Highness will occasion a repetition of useless 
remonstrance from the Shiraz Government 
the failure of which would naturally 
heighten the feeling of discontent already 
excited in the mind of the Prince by 
my late opposition to his wishes, and it hence
appears advisable that my return should
be delayed as long as may be consistent with
prudence, to afford more time for receiving
Instructions either confirming the policy
which I have hitherto adopted, or prescribing 
a line of conduct more agreeable to
the Interests of His Royal Highness_ For
these reasons I shall embark as soons as possible
after


33


after the 1st. September, visit all the allied Ports
and proceed to Bassidore where I shall remain 
till the 15th. October, should there be no
arrival from Bombay previous to that period_

to the Prince of Shiraz my intention to despatch
report to Bombay, of the correspondance which
has passed between us and expressed my willingness 
to forward any communication
which he might think proper to make to
Government on the subject, it is reasonable to
conclude that His Royal Highness has not
considered it expedient to avail himself of the
opportunity, and I shall therefore direct the
Nautilus to proceed on her Voyage early tomorrow 
morning, thus leaving another day for the 
chance of a Cossid's arrival_ This measure
appears to me the more necessary from being

Altho' I am not aware of the

I have reason to believe that it has always

own request from the Residency, for this particular

The Articles alluded in your letter,
were supplied by Mr. Riach during my absence,
and it does not appear that any Estimate was made
of the Value of the Shawls previous to their delivery 
to Lt. Brucks, but from my own recollection
of their quality and the inquiries which I have

We have much pleasure in
acknowledging the receipt of your letter the
contents of which we have understood._ There
are however several things that you have
taken in a light different to what we intended. 
We know you to be adorned with the qualities 
of truth and faithfulness and being free
from selfishness and prejudice are fixed in
the place of friendship and good will towards
both Governments_ It is well known that
no action of yours will ever be opposed to 
the established rules, and that our confidence
and reliance may be increased it is necessary
that in the way of friendship on every occasion 
you seek the interest and advantage
of the Government and act in a manner
becoming a well wisher thereto in order that
your purity of intention and disinterested
faith may daily become more evident and
apparent._ We know you to be wise, Excellent,
learned, and a well wisher of the Govt.
and it is from your wisdom and superior
abilities that we place our hope of your
services._ When you heard of the capture
of the Noosrut Shah you should by any


51
means or in any manner you might consider
most advisable have obtained her restitution
as properly speaking she belonged to this Govt.
At the time when Shaik Abdool Russool
first intended undertaking a Journey we
wrote to His Excellency the Governor of Bombay 
informing him that we had committed
the Vessels of the Durrya Begee into the 
charge of the English Cruizers, in order that
they should sustain no damage or loss._ We
have now again addressed another seperate
letter to H.H. Governor, requesting him
to give orders that the aforesaid Vessel be
retaken without any hesitation and give
up to her proper owners._ As soon as you have
made yourself acquainted with the contents
of this Ruqum you will be pleased to forward
the letter to His Excellency with all possible
expedition and accompany it with a full
and complete exposition, in order that the
aforesaid Vessel may be retaken and given
up to those to whom she belongs_ you are
doubtless aware of the great affection we bear
towards you in consequence of the friendly
disposition we have always witnessed in you
and we confidently expect that in the generality 
of the things that we may require from 
you, you will do every thing in your power
towards their completion._ You are the
bearer of the trust and confidence of both
Govts.

It is with infinite pleasure
I acknowledge the receipt of your friendly letter 
and was highly gratified at hearing of
the continuance of your good health as well
as with the kind expressions contained in your
communication_ you complain of the contents 
of the letters addressed by me and the
one forwarded by Mirza Ally Ukbar by my
directions on the subject of the affair of the
Ship Nussrut Shah, but I beg to assure you
they were written solely in the spirit of
friendship and tho you have viewed them
in a different light my sole intention was
that of friendly complaint._ It would be
a reflection on my self and family were it
possible with the opportunities I have engaged 
in your society of observing the 
excellent


53
qualities you possess together with
your judgement and intelligence, if I should
not have been aware of them, or should
have expressed sentiments at all confirming
the idea that I entertained contrary opinions._ 
I desired Mirza Ally Ukbar, to lay
the circumstances before you solely as expressing 
a hope .but I "alas you know not
who is worthy to be trusted I am your friend
and yet you know me not."_ It is astonishing 
notwithstanding the Intelligence Judgement, 
prudence, sagacity and penetration
you possess. that from the style of friendly 
remonstrance in which I addressed you
you should have been still unaware of
my sincere friendship, for "your name is
on tongue and your affection in my heart
imbibed with my mothers milk and only
to be eradicated with life"_ By the Grace of God
it is impossible to my latest breath to listen
to a single word that might tend even in the
course of a thousand years to produce a grain
of confusion in the friendship I may entertain 
towards any individual._ When the intelligence 
of the capture of the Nussrut Shah
and the incorrect conduct of His Highness
Saed Syed was brought to the notice of the
Prince considering the great friendship existing 
between you and His Highness the
Imam and the important employment in 
which


54
Shaik Abdool Russool was engaged
that of taking charge of the Princesses during
their Pilgrimage to Mecca and his having
 during his absence in a distant land intrusted
all his possessions, people wealth and the Gov.
of his Country into the hands of His Royal
Highness and all for the performance of an
imperative duty in all sects and religions that of
visiting the Holy City_ remembering also the
Friendship and Good understanding of the two
Governments which is shining and resplendent
as the sun in the Horizon of the world_ the 
prosperity and adversity of the one equally
affecting the other_ and His Royal Highness 
the Prince  also conceiving it highly unbecoming 
for the Imam to act in such a manner
towards a Servant who was employed on
such an important affair as to seize his ship
take possession of his Cargo, and then send
her back with the property of the Merchants
to a Bushire with orders to land their Goods
and afterwards being the Vessel away again_
I thought it necessary to write to you on the
above subject in the way and manner of
friendship informing you of the displeasure
of His Royal Highness, adding that you
and myself were the Ministers of the two
Governments and at the same time real and
attached friends that I also entertained
the sincerest affection for Shaik Abdool
Russool


55
that the reckoning the advantage of 
both the Governments and the removal of the
causes of dispute between two brothers, together
with the better arrangement of the affairs of
the Agents of the two Governments was most
advisable and I wrote to you mentioning
that formerly several things had taken place,
which there was every reason to believe had
been excited and produced by Mr. Bruce._
From the time however that, that Gentleman was
removed from his situation, there has never been
the slightest appearance of failure in the
friendship entertained by you towards both
Governments_ Thank God that my dear friend
is entirely free from the corruption and selfishness 
of the age, and that his wisdom and abilities, 
and his whole line of conduct are perfectly 
pure._ You are adorned with the ornaments 
of sagacity prudence, penetration and judgement 
and are therefore stationed at Bushire.
It is well known that when such affairs as
these take place it is only to Friends that one
complains and that an arbitration is necessary 
for their reparation_ Where should we
find besides yourself a disinterested Mediator 
or free from corruptions a mutual
friend to both Governments in the termination 
of every affair to do away the causes
of dispute existing between two friends of
the Government_ Undoubtedly H.H. the
Imam


56
Imam from the friendship he bears the two
Governments and his properly discriminating
between interested and disinterested motives
will adopt such a line of conduct as will 
be most advantageous to his interests under
existing circumstances, the more so when
he considers the serious evils that will arise
from a contrary course._ Shaik Abdool
Russool, his wealth, Family life and reputation are all connected with this Govt.
so far from his being the possessor of the
Vessel in question his very life and Faith
are not his own and of himself he possesses
nothing_ Under these circumstances is it
consistent with honor or the duties of a 
protector, that while employed in taking
charge of the Princesses to the holy city
his people or property should fall into
the hands of an enemy._ It was therefore
on this account that I addressed you in the
manner I did considering that it is only
to a friend one complaing, not to an enemy.
For instance should any individual connected 
with the English have an important 
affair either here or in the Kingdom
of Fars or Tahran to whom would you make
it known or from whom would you expect
its completion besides myself_ and particularly 
considering that my Brother and
Brothers son are high in the service of His
Majesty


57
Majesty you would wish that I should write
to them to procure the remedy required._
It is precisely in this very manner that I
Mahomed Zaqee Khan entertain the same hope
from you, and I will not give up the expectation 
that you as my best friend will take 
measures to do away these evils and that your
credit may be accordingly exalted, and that
I may rejoice that my Friend has interfered
and settled the affair._ With regard to what 
you informed me that you could not take
any steps without the previous sanctions of the
Hon'/'ble the Governor_ His Royal Highness the
Prince has accordingly addressed a letter to
His Excellency requesting his directions may
be sent you together with orders for the recovery 
of the Ship Noosrut Shah and the
whole of the property of the Derrya Begee
I have also sent a communication to the
Governments which I shall feel obliged by
your forwarding with the other and at the
same time requesting an answer._ His Royal 
Highness who is the benefactor of myself
and the Derrya Begee, trusts that in some
way or other you will procure the restitution
of the ship and her Cargo_ I your friend also cannot 
take any excuse from you but hope that
you will act in the manner you may consider most
adviseable for getting back the aforesaid Vessel
and I swear by the Qooran and by truth that
this


50
this what I desire and expect from my beloved 
friend._

Gentlemen,
Being about to proceed on a

to vest you, with authority for conducting
the duties of the Residency during my absence
or until the arrival of Dr. Riach, Mr. Efsai
will


61

and both will be assisted in cases of emergency 
by the experience of Mr. Arrathoon Malcolm, 
as it is desirable that all communications 
with the Shaik or Government of
Bushire should be carried on through one
fixed channel. Mr. Efsai will be pleased to
performed this, when necessary, in addition to
his other duties but in all his intercourse with 
the authorities here, he will be guided by the opinion 
of the majority of the committeee._
The following are the only subjects 
to which it will be requisite to direct
your attention, Vizt. Money transactions_
Forwarding Packets, and addressing remonstrances 
to the Government of Bushire in any
urgent causes of injury or injustice to British
trade or to Persons under the Protection of the
Residency_ such circumstances however,
are merely to be brought to the notice of the
Shaik, who it is hoped will afford immediate
redress. but no further steps are to be taken
under any circumstances whatever, without
further instructions and a full Statement
of the affair must be dispatched for my information 
by the earliest opportunity.
The Balance of Cash left in the
Treasury will it is it hoped be sufficient to defray 
all charges till my return._ In the event of any
drafts


62
on the Residency from the Mission
the Balance of Colonel Macdonalds Cash
is to be applied to their payment and the
remaining Bills on Bengal disposed of to
the best advantage to meet those demands_
To prevent the possibility of any deficiency,
in cases of emergency I shall however leave
Blank Bills on the Bombay Government
for 15,000 Rupees, but these are only to be had
recourse to at the last extremity and an express 
Boat is to be dispatched to me without 
delay, with immediate intimation of
the Circumstances._
During my absence Boats
will be sent to Bassidore every 10 days with
any letters that may arrive from Bussora
or the Interior of Persia together with such
other informations as it may be thought necessary 
to communicate_ The first Boat
is not to be dispatched till 15 days after
my departure._

The Chief Secretary to Government
Sir,
I have the honor to report that
on the progress of my tour to the Arabian
Coast I touched at Bassidore on the 19th.
Instant and finding that the Imam was
then at Kishem with Several Ships, I determined


66
on requesting a personal interview
with His Highness in order to concert a plan
for the settlement of the petty differences between
Derah and Debaye, as well as for the purpose 
of ascertaining the nature and object
of his projects in the Gulf._ Immediately
after my arrival at Bassidore I received
a letter from His Highness addressed to me
at Bushire, stating that he had succeeded
in capturing Shaikh Abdool Russol Khan
and two of his Vessels on his return from
the Red Sea; a Translation of this letter I
have herewith the honor to inclose and
the contents presented an additional motive
for my visiting Kishem, in the hope of being
able by friendly intercession to ameliorate the
condition of the Captive Shaikh, in event of
his standing in need of my good Offices, as 
far as his comfort or safety were concerned._
2.
Since my arrival here I have
paid my respects to His Highness, but have had
no opportunity of a private conference, nor do
I conceive that the result of our interview can
be of sufficient importance to justify the detention 
of the Amherst for four and twenty
hours longer; I have also paid a visit to
Shaikh Abdool Russool Khan who appears
very much depressed by his misfortunes, but
is treated with kindness by the Imam, and 
furnished with every accommodation necessary 


67


to his comfort_ He expressed himself
most grateful to me for this mark of attention
to him during his present hopeless state of 
degradation, but did not enter into any particulars 
respecting his expectations or future
prospects I have requested that he may be
permitted to return my visit and shall consider 
myself bound to treat him with the
same honors and ceremony as if he were still
at the head of his Government._
I have been able to obtain but
3.
few details respecting the capture of the Shaikh
in addition to those mentioned in the Imam's
letter_ The Shaikh himself appeared inclined 
to make a serious resistance, but
an explosion took place which killed and
wounded a number of his crew._ This disheartened 
the remainder and his other ship.
Keeping a loof from the Engagement he
thought it prudent to strike his Colours
and proceeded on board the Imam's ship
as a Prisoner_ His Highness appears by no
means desirous of being burthened with the
Government of Bushire, since the accomplishment 
of his designs against the
Shaikh by more direct means, but he seems 
to be still actuated by a vindictive feeling
which I fear will prevent the success of
any intercession on his behalf_ He had however 
assured me that his measures shall be 
confined


68
to the capture of the Shaikhs own
Vessels and personal property, and that he
is far from entertaining the slightest hostile 
intentions towards the Inhabitants of
Bushire or the Persian Government._
In the course of tomorrow I shall
wait again upon the Imam to discuss the
affairs of the Arab Coast and trust that
with his assistance I shall be enabled to
check every symptom of discontent among
the Arab Chieftains before my return to
Bushire_ It is supposed that all his Vessels 
will return with him to Muscat as 
soon as he has succeeded in quitting some
disturbances which have broken out in the
Minow District_

The wounded man had been sent on board

The Secretary to Government
Sir,
Having on reconsideration, thought
it adviseable to detain the Amherst for another
day, I now avail myself of the opportunity
to report that I have had a conversation with
the Imam respecting the affairs of the Gulf,
in the course of which I was sorry to learn
that His Highness no longer possessed any
influence over the Sooeedan Tribe, having
failed in obtaining their consent to abandon
Derah, which they had rebuilt and were determined 
to occupy as formerly_ It would
appear however that they have become in a
great measure reconciled to Sultan ben Sugger
and that the evil consequences which were
apprehended from their remaining in his
neighbourhood have been thus materially
diminished, I have therefore considered it prudent 
to decline the Imam's Offer of compelling
their


72
their removal by force of Arms, lest an attack
on the Tribe might rekindle the hostilities
which have for the present subsided in that
quarter._
With regard to Bussorah the
Imam seems determined to assert his rights,
to the utmost of his power and has given orders 
to his fleet to prevent all intercourse
of Vessels belonging to the Gulf with that City
till his demands are complied with_ This restriction 
does not extend to Indian Vessels
and the measure will probably be soon attended 
with the desired effect.
Finding that the Shaikh of
3
Bushire had not been permitted, notwithstanding 
the affected acquiescence of His 
Highness to return my visit on board the
Clive, I sent a message to him this evening
acquainting him with my intention of sailing 
tomorrow, expressing at the same time
my regret at not having had the pleasure 
of seeing him again and begging to know
how I could be of service to him;_ In reply
to this communication I received a Note 
of which the inclosed is a Translation, together 
with a letter to the address of the
Hon'ble the Governor, which I likewise
do myself the honor to forward having
first ascertained that the Imam has no

To,
The Secretary to Government
Sir,
In hopes of being able to remove the
jealousies arising from the refusal of the Soocedan 
Tribe to abandon their settlement at Derah
I proceeded to the Arabian Coast on the 11th. Instt.
and had an Intercourse with Shaikh Sooltan
Ben Sugger, who appears to take up his residence
at Ras ul Khima_ This Chieftain seemed nearly
free from those symptoms of discontent which he
has generally manifested on former occasions and
only complained of the obstinacy of Sulmine ben
Nassir in maintaining his position contrary to a
agreement and to the injury of the 
Interests of the people of Sharga as well as those
of the neighbouring Tribes_ He therefore expressed
an earnest wish to be permitted to dislodge him
by force, but as this would have occasioned an
immediate rupture with Shaikh Tanoon and
involved the whole Coast in fresh disturbances
I begged him to refrain from offensive measures
till I could visit Abothabee and endeavor to
obtain Shaik Tanoon's consent to the demolition 
of Derah._
With this view accordingly I proceeded
2
towards Abothabee and on my way thither
made a fruitless attempt to prevail upon the
Inhabitants of Derah to conform to the wishes
of


the Imam and the English Government by
means of a written communication to which
I received any evasive answer, complaining of
the people of Debaye and requesting a supply 
of Ammunition to defend their Town
against their Enemies_ On the 14th. Instt. I landed
at Abothabee and addressed Shaikh Tanoon
on the subject of Derah_ In the course of
conversation I endeavoured to convince him 
that the evacuation of Derah had become necessary 
for the preservation of the public
peace which was constantly outraged by the
violenet conduct of the Inhabitants towards
the neighbouring Tribes, who were unanimous in
their wish for their removal_ That both his good
faith and his Interest were chiefly involved in
the execution of this measure, which was 
particularly desirable by his friends the Imam
of Muscat and the English Government both of
whom had given their sanction to the Treaty
whereby the demolition of the fortifications of
Derah was stipulated between him and Shaik
Sooltan nearly two years ago_ I assured him
that his cooperation was by no means necessary 
to effect these expulsion, but that a mere
expression of his wish that they should adhere
to their agreement, would alone ensure a compliance 
with the stipulations of the Treaty
and give immediate effect to an arrangement
so earnestly desired by all but that individual


80
dual Tribe which had no hope of support in
any other quarter_ These arguments failed to
produce the slightest impression on Shaikh
Tanoon who firmly persisted in his determination 
to afford his countenance to the Soocedan 
Tribe under the idea that his character
would be degraded in the estimation of the
public were he to yield to the wishes of Shaik
Sooltan_ I accordingly took my leave with
an expression of regret that he should differ
with his best friends on a point of such importance 
and added that I could no longer 
restrain the people of Sharga and Debaye
from chastising their turbulent Neighbours
but that I should in the first instance communicate 
to the Imam the result of our Interview 
and consult with him on the best means
of preserving the public peace, without preventing
Shaik Sooltan from obtaining redress by force
of arms should he still consider it necessary
On my return to Bassidore I found
that His Highness had proceeded to Muscat,
but as it appeared necessary to take immediate
measures to avert the evils which threatened 
to arise from the determination of Shaikh
Tanoon to support his Dependents at Derah
I lost no time in following him to that place
where I arrived on the 25th. Instant_ The
Imam appears much incensed at the ingratitude 
of Shaikh Tanoon in disregarding 
his


81


his repeated instructions respecting of Derah
and seems apprehensive that any further communication 
on that subject would be treated
with the same want of respect and attention
He has however proposed to send two Ships to
cruize off Derah for the purpose of preventing
any assistance being afforded for Abothabee,
and with orders to maintain the position
till the place may be reduced by the combined 
forces of Sultan ben Suggar and the Shaikh
of Debaye_
This demonstration will probably
be sufficient to ensure the neutrality of Shaik
Tanoon, whose Interests are too closely connected 
with those of His Highness to excite
any fears of its occasioning a rupture between
them. The Imam himself is of this opinion
and has written at my request to Shaikh
Tanoon to signify his intention of cooperating 
with the people of Sharga unless an
immediate arrangement is made for the 
evacuation of Derah, a measure which
can alone prevent the Arab States from
relapsing into a maritime war._

To, The Secretary to Government
Sir,
Having been induced to visit Muscat
for the reasons assigned in my letter to your address 
of this date I considered it my duty to take
advantage of any opportunity that might occur
of entering into an explanation with the Imam
on the subject of your Dispatch N.1044 in the
Political Department and of cautioning His
Highness conformably to the assurances conveyed 
to Commodore Christin against making any
attempt on Mombass before the final decision
of His Majesty's Government should be known 
Having had reason to suppose
that the Despatches intrusted to Captn. Brucks
had reference to this circumstance, I did not
consider it adviseable to introduce the subject
without some previous intimation from His
Highness I soon discovered however that he
had received no communication respecting
the correspondance with Commodore Christian
but on the contrary was surprised to hear him
express his satisfaction at the removal of the
whole of the British Establishment from 
Mombass which had been reported to him in a
recent letter from Zanzibar_ This information I
was at first led to consider premature, but the 
date and tenor of the document alluded to, a
translation of which I have the honor to inclose
preclude all reasonable doubt of the truth of
the intelligence and I congratulated His Highness 
accordingly _ I thought it necessary to
observe


83
observe however that the view which had been
taken of the subject by the new Naval Commander 
rendered it particularly desirable that he
should await further information from Bombay
previous to adopting any steps for the recovery
of his possessions in that quarters on which
suggestion His Highness willingly acquiesced,
expressing his determination to be guided by 
the ultimate decision of His Majesty's Govern.t_
In reply to a request from His
3
Highness to be informed whether he might
consider himself at liberty to send a force against 
the New Settlement alluded to in the
last paragraphs of the letter for the Wali of
Zanzibar, I have considered it prudent to express 
my opinion that if the place had at
any time been under the controul of Bombassa
or taken under the protection of British authorities 
it would be adviseable to defer its reduction 
till the general question was decided but
that if otherwise it of course rested with His
Highness to adopt whatever measures he
might think proper on the occasion._

1826._
With regard to the News from
A.C.
Bombassa we have ascertained that the English
have removed from thence and that not one


84
Individual of that nation is remaining on the Island
We have also heard that the people of that Island
wish to have an interview with your Highness
The People of the Mozumbigue intend sending
two Frigates which will probably pass by us one 
of these is intended to proceed to Goa and
Duman, and the other to Muscat._ We informed
you before of our having sent Saif ben Hummud
ben Syed to the Mozambigue and of the great attention and
politeness with which he was received, that every thing
he had asked was agreed to and the former duties which
were 22p.r Cent agreeably to his request we modified
to 10p.r  Cent in order to confirm this they have given
a written document which is now in our possession
On Saif ben Hummud's departure from that place he 
proceeded to Sefa and Sufala for the purpose of
traffic and received the attention there that he had
at the Mozambigue he desired some of his people
to procure Ballast for his Vessel without asking permission 
from the Governor of these places _ The people he
had sent being unfortunately of a quarrelsome disposition 
commenced a dispute with some of the Inhabitants 
without the knowledge of Saif ben Hummud
in the course of which one of his People named -/-
Khemees ben Saleh was killed._ The Vessel that is
bound for muscat is sent for the purpose of explain
ing this unlucky affair to your Highness and exculpating 
themselves from blame and your Highness
may be certain that they will agree to any thing
you may think proper to ask as the Inhabitants
of the Mozambigue hold your power in the
greatest awe and their desire is to reestablish the
relations of amity and friendship between them
and


85
and your Highness. _We have received intelligince
that the People of the Port of Moota have seized
and plundered a French Vessel that came in
this for the purpose of trading 
of her Crew soon after this a Vessel arrived
from Bombose and made enquiries regarding 
Moota whether the inhabitants were subject of
your Highness or not to which we answered
that they were not and the Vessel returned to-
Bombose_ With regard to Zenzeebar an Individual
named Naser bin Eesa, who has erected a very strong
building between Zenzeebar and the Mosombigue
which he has garrisoned with 60 Soldiers with
Musquets_ as the place he has taken possession of
has a very convenient anchorage nearly all the French
Ships anchor there and he carries on a very extensive 
Slave Trade with them and by means of various 
duties and imports draws a very considerable 
income._ He is on terms of strict amity with
the Sultan of Kuluor who is associated with him
in his Traffic of Slaves._

To,

Chief Secretary to Government
Sir,
I do myself the honor to report my
return to this place from my late tour to the
Arabian Coast on the 14.th Instant._
A few days previous to my arrival 
2
here a revolution was effected in the Government
of which Shaik Ahmed ben Khamis a distant
relation of the late Governor, is now in possession, 
to the exclusion of Shaik Abdool Russool 
Khan and his children._ This person who
is said to be descended from an elder branch of
the family has always asserted his claim to a
share in the Government, but was expetled from
Bushire by Shaik Abdool Russool, and has
for several years past resided under the protection 
of the Chaub Shaik in the neighbourhood of Bussorah _ at the commencement
of the present quarrel with Muscat Shaik
Ahmed was invited by the Acting Governor
Shaik Mohumed to return to Bushire and
assist in the defence of his Native Country,
since which period he has gradually acquired
the favor of the Inhabitants and at length
become


87


become sufficiently powerful to deprive both
the son and uncle of Shaik Abdool Russool
Khan of all authority, having latterly assumed
the entire direction of the Government._
Shaik Ahmed's reputation for
3.rd
bravery and liberality has rendered him extremely 
popular among all classes of people,
particularly with the Arab Tribes in the dependent 
Villages who have sworn to devote
their lives to his service and to support him
against all his Enemies_ The Merchants of
Bushire have likewise expressed their satisfaction 
at the late charge in the administration, 
which affords them an immediate prospect
of relief from the burthensome restrictions occasioned 
by the commercial pursuits of the late
Governor, whose oppressive monopoly threatened 
to involve them in ruin and had already produced 
a most injurious effect on the general trade
and prosperity of the port. _ The revolution was
effected without the slightest disturbance, and an
intimation of the event was dispatched to the
authorities of Shiraz, who it is supposed will find
themselves compelled to sanction the existing
arrangements._
Shaik Ahmed visited me im=
4.
mediately after my arrival and has done
all in his power to impress me with a sense
of his attachment to the British Government_
I have considered myself bound to acknowledge
his civilities and shall even return his visit
as soon as I recover from a slight indisposition
which at present prevent my leaving the 
Residency_


88
Residency_ Being actually in possession of the
Chief authority at this place Shaik Ahmed must
of necessity be referred to in all matters connected 
with the local duties of the Residency, but
I have given him to understand that however
gratified I may individually feel at the beneficial 
consequences which appear to have resulted 
from his accession to power, I cannot publicly 
acknowledge him as the legitimate Governor
till his title shall be confirmed by the Shiraz
Government._Shaik Mahomed seems perfectly. 
reconciled to the change, and is even suspected 
of having willingly concurred in the
transfer of authority from certain considerations 
with which the seizure of the treasure 
belonging to the late Governor, has enabled 
Shaik Ahmed to satisfy his scruples._

Sir,
I have the honor to acquaint you
that I have returned to Bushire from my visit
to


to the Arabian Chieftains, which various unforeseen 
circumstances have protracted to a much
longer period than I anticipated on my departure_ 
While at Kishem where I proceeded to have 
an interview with the Imam of Muscat, I availed
myself of the opportunity to wait on the Shaik
of Bushire, who had been captured about a 
fortnight previous to my arrival._ He was not
permitted to return my visit altho the Imam
assured me that he was at liberty to do so; but
I found that obstacles were thrown in the way
of his leaving the ship, and he was obliged at last
to content himself with intrusting to my care
a letter addressed to the Governor of Bombay
representing as I understood, the situation to which
he had been reduced, and soliciting his interference 
on his behalf. This letter I accordingly 
transmitted to Bombay and acquainted the
Imam of the circumstance._
On my arrival here I found that
a change had taken place in the Government
from which the son and uncle of Shaik
Abdool Russool Khan had been removed by
Shaik Ahmed ben Khamis, a distant relation
of the family who came to Bushire in consequence 
of the invitation of the acting Governors
to assist in the defence of the place, when
threatened by the Muscat fleet on the breaking 
out of hostilities._ As far as I can understand 
the change has given general satisfaction 
to all classes of people both in
the Town and dependent Villages, and the
Government has been hitherto conducted
with


moderation and justice Shaik Ahmed
98
has long been a favorite with the Arabs of this
part of the Country and the extreme dislike
which prevailed towards Shaik Abdool Russool's 
administration, appears to have united
the public voice in his favor_ The revolution
however has not yet been sanctioned at Shiraz
and it is difficult from warious contradictory
reports and in fact from the vaccilating nature 
of the Princes Councils to form any decided 
opinion as to the result It appetars probable 
however that the present Ruler will be
formally acknowledged at least till a favorable 
opportunity occurs of replacing him by
one of the numerous candidates who are said
to have prefered their claims on this Government 
as soon as intelligence was received of
the capture of Shaik Abdool Russool Khan._
Last Night, Shaik Nassir, the
eldest son of the late Governor, fled from the
House of his Grand Uncle, where he has resided
over since his deposition and threw himself
on my protection to avoid as he declared the
intended violence of Shaik Ahmed_ On such
an appeal I could not hesitate to grant him
an asylum altho it was my earnest wish, and
had hitherto been my invariable practice, to
abstain from the slightest interference with
the sguabbles here, and in those terms I communicated 
the circumstance to Shaik Ahmed
giving him at the same time to understand
that I should consider myself bound in honor 
to afford the young Shaik a place of
security


99


security as long as he might find it convenient
to remain at the Residency_ In reply to this
Message Shaik Ahmed expressed his surprise at
the step taken by Shaik Nassir, who he assure
me, had always been treated by him with the
utmost delicacy and never had the remotest
cause of apprehension for his personal safety
that he could not however but feel grateful
for the Kindness with which his relation had
been received and that he should look upon
my friendly attentions to Shaik Nassir in the
light of a favor conferred on himself._
In the prevent state of affairs here
I should hope that the Government of Shiraz
cannot feel offended at the conduct which circumstances 
have compelled me to pursue on this
occasion, nor misconstrue a common act of
hospitality into an officious interference with
matters connected with their authority, but my
past experience of the extraordinary suspecions 
entertained by that Government on occasions 
less liable to misconstruction, render
me uncertain of the light in which this
affair may be viewed, and has induced me
to put in possession of the simple facts as an
antidote against misrepresentation hereafter

Envoy to the Court of Persia
Sir,
With reference to your letter dated
the 11th. September last I have the honor to report
the arrival of the Duffadar and 16 Servars
enumerated in the Muster Roll inclosed therein 
on the 22nd. Instt. and to inform you that
agreeably to your request they shall be forwarded 
to Bombay by the first opportunity and
that your intimation regarding their Pay during
their stay at Bushire and the transmission
of their Abstracts and Pay Certificates to the
Accountant


104
Accountant General at Bombay shall be attended 
to.
According to your directions the
Muleteer has been paid the Sum of 46 Tomans
being the balance due to him for the hire of 21
Mules and the Duffadar having made a favorable 
report of his conduct while on the
march I have presented him with the additional 
5 Tomans the both of which payments
shall be charged to the Bombay Government
By the Native Officer commanding 
the above Party I also received a communication 
from Major Hart informing me that
he had been directed by you to forward a part
of the Escort consisting of a Jemidar and 5 
Troopers who had remained behind sick at Tabriz
on to Bushire and inclosing their Pay Certificates 
together with a receipt from the Muleteer
for 164 Reals in part of the hire of 6 Mules from
that place at 5 Tomans each and requesting
me to pay the remaining sum due to him on
their arrival, the Duffadar at the same time
reported to me that the above 6 Individuals
proceeded with them as far as Hamadan where
Jemidar informed him that he intended to
go on a pilgrimage to Kerbella along with 
the 5 Troopers who had remained with him 
in Tabriz and desired him to take the remainder 
of the party on to Bushire where he expected 
to arrive as soon as them by the way
of Bagdad; of course he was unable to remostrate 
against the orders of his Superior Officer 
but the Mehmander who accompanied
them


105


them objected very strongly to such an arrangement 
as his orders were to proceed direct to
Bushire and the lemidar was well aware that
he had received no permission either for him
self or party to visit any place out of the direct
road. His representation however proved unavailing, 
and the lemidar with his 5 Companions 
pursued his way towards Kerbela having
first given the Duffadar a letter for me wherein
he requested that I would deduct the hire of two
Mules from the Muleteer as in consequence of
his refusal to supply him with them he had been
under the necessely of hiring others in their
room in conseqience however of the unauthorized 
manner in which the Jemidar had seperated 
himself from his party without any
permission from either you or Major Hart I
did not think it necessary to pay any attention 
to this communication but directed the
Muleteer to be paid the whole of the balance
due to him amounting to 76 Reals._
The Mehmandar who accompanied 
the Party down here having conducted
himself enterely to my satisfaction I have
directed the sum of Twenty Tomans to be given
him._

Sir,
I have the honor to represent to
you that since the arrival of the new
Residency


106
Residency Guard a stoppage appear to have been
made for the provisions of the Subadar amount
ing to the whole of his Batta or 15 Rupees -/-
monthly, whereas it appears to have been
the praclice to deduct from the Iemidar of the
former Guard only 3 Rupees pr. Month in payment 
for his rations which is half a rupee more
than the deduction made from the pay of each
Rank and file of the Detachment: Under the
idea that the stoppage in question has oreginated
in error and that the charge for rations is intended 
to be the same for all ranks, I beg to be permitted 
to pay the Subador the arrears which
would be due to him at the above rate from
the date of his arrival, and to credit him here
after for the difference between his Monthly
Balta and the established deduction for provisions 
whatever that may amount to._

upon as correct, or at least considered as a
fair estimate on which the amount may be
sanctioned provided it shall be properly authenticated

precluded in compliance with the directions

this event has removed the principal obstacles
which have so long prevented the reestablishment

measures which you may adopt for the attainment
of this object however it is the earnest wish of the
British Government that you will not find it necessary 
to punish with severity the errors of the
Inhabitants, but that the Interest which they
feel in the fate of a people who have once,
altho' perhaps unjustifiably thrown themselves
in their protection, may induce your Highness to
treat them with a degree of lenity to which
their

their conduct might not entitle them _ These friendly 
considerations will I am persuaded secure the
people of Mombassa from experiencing the weight
of your just resentment but the project which they
are supposed to have in contemplation, of soliciting 
assistance from the French authorities at the
Island of Bourbon, may render it prudent to
adopt such a system of conciliation as may
make them indifferent to foreign connexions
and lay the foundation of a firm attachments

that up to the present moment no steps what
ever have been taken by the Shiraz Government

116
towards obtaining a remunitation for his losses._
In consideration of the unwillingness of the authorities 
there to interfore in his behalf I had accordly 
adopted the resolution of sending him to
Muscat in order that he might be enabled to
avail himself of the first opportunity of proceeing 
from thence to Johanna when a Firman from
His Majesty addressed to the Prince Governor of
Fars directing immediate restitution of all the
plundered property at Dashtee induced me to
postpone his departure in the hope of receiving
a satisfactory reply to the letter which I addresed 
on that occasion to the Vizier at Shiraz, but
as I now find that no beneficial consiquinces
are likely to result from the Kings orders, I have
again directed Syed Humza to prepare for his
departure._ The utmost Economy shall be observed

should hope that the expence to Government will
not exceed 400 Rupees in addition to the amount

ground for apprehending the disapprobation
of Government on this occasion, altho in the present
state of feeling manifested by the Shiraz authorities, 
it is by no means improbable that it may
give rise to unpleasant discussions still however, 
if any credit may he attached to their
earnest and repeated expressions of regret for
the fate which has befallen the late Governor 
to the sincerity of their applications for his
release, it is to be presumed that they will refrain 
from displaying such palpable inconsistency, 
as to exhibit any displeasure at an
act of Kindness shown to his nearest relations-
Shaikh


118
Ahmed himself still professes the same
friendly interest in the welfare of both the fugatives, 
and has authorized me to make the most
liberal offes to Shaik Nassir, with the assurance
of any pledge or security that I might consider
necessary for their fulfilment but the Young
Shaik is firm in resisting all compromisetwith
the usurper of his fathers rights, and avows his
determination to encounter any difficultiesor
privations rather than submit to the degradation 
of acknowledging him for a Superior._
Shaik Ahmed has within these
fewdays been confimed in the Government of
Bushire by a Firman from His Royal Highness 
who has likewise conferred on him the
title of khan together with the Office of Deria
Beggy a Khillaut of honor and every other
Mark of distinction which has been usually bestowed

being communicated to me by Shaik Ahmed

Sir,
I have the honor to acquaint you
that


119
that I have this day received a Reckum from His
Royal Highness the Prince of Shiraz together with
a letter from the Minister of Fars which I conceive
it necessary to submit to the notice of Government
by the earliest opportunity, preparatory to which
I beg to offer a short introduction to its contents,
in the following statement._
During my late absence from the
2
Residency Major Jervis in passing thro' Shiraz
was inoited by Zekee Khan to an Interview, at
which the latter took occasion publicly to accuse
Coll. Macdonald and myself of having broken
the treaty subsisting between the two Nations
by exciting the Imam of Muscat to hostilities
with the Shaik of Bushire, and had even the
assurance to assert that four English Ships assisted 
at the capture of the latter Chieftain_
This circumstance was immediately communicated 
by Major Jervis to Coll. Macdonald in a
private letter, a Copy of which was at the same
time forwarded to me, but as the imputation
there cast on my conduct was in fact but a repetition 
of the calumnies formerly reported to
Government in a more official shape, I did not
intend to have brought it to their notice till the
Envoy had expressed his sentiments respecting it_
In replying however to a letter which I had received 
from Zekee Khan requesting my interference
on behalf of Shaikh Abdool Russool Khan I
found it necessary to advert to his conversation
with Major Jervis as a reason for declining to
communicate further with him on that subject,
and this reply has given rise to the letter above
alluded


18
alluded to which has induced me to anticipate
my report to Government on the subject at large_
I now beg to submit for their information Copies
of all the documents mentioned in the foregoing
explanation, together with that of a short correspondence 
with the Prince of Shiraz and an
Extract of a letter just received from Our Agent
at that place, which is I doubt not worthy of credit
and places the intrigues of Zekee Khan in a clearer
point of view than even his own communication._
From these letters it is plain that
3
the Prince and his Minister irritated at the censure 
conveyed in the Royal Firman, and apprehensive 
of the consequences of the second groundless 
and insulting accusation against Colonel
Macdonald and myself have boldly resolved on
attempting to substantiate those charges, and in aid
of this manuvre have endeavoured to excite the jealous
feelings of his Majesty by exaggerated statements
of the Imam's Pride and consequence and by representing 
our marine Depot at Bassidore, as a clandestine 
settlement in a remote part of his Dominions,
but this illdigested effect cannot fail to recoil on its
author whose notorious intrigues and breachs of
faith both with the late unfortunate Governor of
this place and the Imam himself, are well known
to the Envoy, and will doubtless together with the
true state of our connexion with Bassidore, be
laid before His Majesty's Ministers and obviate
the Mischievous tendency of Zekee Khan's machinations._
Colonel Macdonald is already
4
acquainted with the grounds on which I have
laid claim to a restitution of the property plundered


121


from the Boats wrecked off the Coast of
Dashtee and I shall endeavour to put him in possession
of such further information on this subject
as may appear neccessary to refute the flimsy misstatements 
in Zekee Khan's letter_ It is true however 
that the Buglow from Bombay together
with its Cargo was the property of Persian Merchants 
altho' insured by British subjects, and
in the absence of any representation from the
latter quarter I should be doubtful of the propriety
of persisting in a demand for remuneration_
This question of right however in such cases ought
to be clearly defined, and I shall take the liberty
to suggest to the Envoy the necessity for obtaining
an explicit declaration from His Majesty's Ministers 
on this subject._

In a fortunate time and auspicious

and beg to express the gratification I felt at hearing
of your continued good health._ With reference
to the conduct of Saed Syed and the misrepresentations 
you state in your letter to have been
made by me regarding you I shall enter into a
full explanation and accompany it with the
most satisfactory proofs, for my conscience
is quite clear from the pollution of this thing
and


122
and I have never been guilty of either lie or
falsehood in the course of our friendship.
_
During the time the Ambassador honored this
place with his presence and resided in the
Tukht Bagh he one day informed Mohumed
Mehdy Khan that in consequence of the dispute 
which had taken place between His Highness 
the Imam and Shaik Abdool Russool
the former had determined to proceed to the Port
of Bushire with his Ships and Troops, with
this intelligence Mohumed Mehdy Khan acquainted 
the principal individuals of the Govern.t_
The next day I went to visit the Ambassador
and made inquiries regarding what had been
communicated to me, he confirmed all that
I had heard a few days after the Ambassador
received a letter from you reporting the Imams
hostile designs against Bushire and his intention 
of annoying and injuring all those
connected with Abdool Russool with the contents 
of which he orally informed me. Being
thus convinced of the correctness of the report
I thought proper to write to Shaik Mohumed
Khan, desiring him to be on his guard and
prepared lest he should be taken by surprise
and suffer accordingly. After a short period
the information of the capture of the Noosrut 
Shah by H.H. the Imam was received
and I addressed a full communication to
you on the subject and bearing in mind what
you have lately brought to my notice that in the 5th.
Article of the Treaty between the two Governments it
is specified, "that on all occasion of difficulty happening


123


to the Servants or subjects of either Kingdom
it is incumbent on the Ministers of their respective
Governments to render them every assistance.) I received 
an answer from you stating that without
receiving instructions or directions from the Governor
in Bombay you could not think of taking any
steps in the affair of yourself and that it was
impossible for you to do any thing without their
direction or permission_ The result was that
on the receipt of this answer and His Royal
Highness the Prince being made acquainted
with the circumstances, a letter was addressed
to the Governor in Bombay by H.R. Highness
which I had the pleasure of forwarding with
a letter from myself for the purpose of being
transmitted to the Presidency. Since that time
your departure for Muscat was currently reported 
tho' I received no communication or intelligence 
from you to inform me for what
purpose you had proceeded to that place_ It
was also commonly said and which from your
prudence and intelligence I conceived very probable 
that your object in visiting Muscat was to
restore and establish concord and friendship
between His Highness and Shaik Abdool Russool 
and to bring away the latter with you._
I have this day received your letter complaining 
of my conduct but am at loss to discover
when and in what instance I have acted on
unfriendly part._ With reference to that portion 
of your letter requiring the restitution
of the Vessel and Cargo belonging to the English 
Government I beg to answer that from
the


124
letters and reports of the Merchants of every
country it is completely ascertained that the
Vessel in question was the property of Hajee Jabir
and had no connection with your Government
and that Saed Humza's property consisted of
a few articles while all the remaining Cargo was
composed of Goods belonging to Persian Merchants. 
When the intelligence of the Vessels
being wrecked was received at Shiraz, I inquired
of the Ambassador about it he told me that a
few Articles such as 40 lamps &ca, &ca, belonged
to the English I pressed him very strongly to
give me an authenticated list which he promised 
to send, but at last said that it was
not in his power to do so._There is certainly a
compact and agreement that should any English
Vessel be wrecked on their Coasts that the Governors 
of the different ports are not to injure or
distress them in any manner whatever, but
should the Vessel belong to any one else it there
under the above circumstances becomes the
property of the Country or Governor near
which it may strike. I cannot however agree
with you that the above mentioned Bugla
belonged to the English. as it is well known
to be the propetty of Hajee Jabir._ I now come
to the inquiry of where and in what manner
the Vessel was wrecked and broken up. It appears 
that after she struck the Inhabitants
assembled from every port and place in the
neighbourhood to get what they could and
that after then the people of Dashty came
on to participate in carrying away the property


125


of which they may have obtained a small
portion or otherwise as it happened_ agreeably
to the well known and long established justice
here any Vessel not belonging to the English on
ris being wrecked becomes the property of the
place where it strikes without any respect to
these who may have been her former owners._
It is quite impossible to ascertain out of the
large number of seafaring individuals connected
with the different ports in the neighbourhood
into whose hands every small portion of the
Cargo of a wrecked Vessel may have fallen_
and as I before stated all the Merchants unanimously 
agree that the above Vessel belonged to
Hajee Jabir and had Persian property on board_
It has lately been brought to His Royal Highnes's 
notice that a number of the Servants and
Individuals connected with the English have
settled in and are residing upon the Island of
Keshm without any sanction having been received 
for their so doing._ This is contrary to
the friendship and usage established between
the two Governments_ should you however
have represented this affair to His Majesty the
King of Persia and received his Royal Firman
or permission H.H. the Prince of Shiraz will of
course pay every attention to it as the Govern.t
of the whole Kingdom is in the hands of His
Majesty's Ministers and no one can venture to
dispute their orders. Should you (on the other
hand) not be in possession of His Majesty's
Royal permission for the English to settle
and reside in the Island of Kishm it will
be


126
the means of interrupting the good understanding 
existing between our respective Governments_
This your friend considers it incumbent on himself 
to bring to your notice._ With regard to the
latter part of your friendly communication
mentioning that the Government of Oman is a
Government like Persia or England I am in doubt
whether it is a mistake of your writer, or whether
it was written by your desire_ as to this day no
Country in the whole world could ever put itself
on a footing of equality with ours, nor any living
individual ever speak of their Governments so as
to mention the Kingdom of Oman at the same
time with His Majestys dominions, which I understand 
to be the meaning of your letter._

Extract from a letter from Mirza Ally Akbar
British Agent at Shiraz to Col.l Stanns C.B.
dated 4.th Jumadce ul uval or 4th Dec.r 1826. _
I have seen the draft of the letter
addressed to the King of Persia by His Royal Highness 
the Prince of Shiraz and the substance of
it is as follows that Shaik Abdool Russool Khan
was a true faithful and loyal well wisher to
the Government and would not pass over any
improper or incorrect conduct from any one
individual particularly with reference to the
English carrying on an intercourse (with Persia)
whom he used to forbid whenever he perceived
them acting contrary to friendship or good understanding 
by degrees the above mentioned Individuals 
feeling inimically disposed towards
him advanced Saed Syed who is both unfit and
unworthy of any dignity and excited an enmity
between him and the Shaik, in consequence of
which he seized the latter on his return from
Mecca, and now keeps him a prisoner: the English
also in their correspondance consider the Imam
as possessed of a dignity and Government equal
to the Kingdom of Persia, he himself entertaining


128
a similar opinion of his own importance puts
his Seal to all his letters in the same place as
His Majesty_ That a communication from
the Imam to Meer Ghoolam Ally Khan Roodoonce 
with his Seal stampt at the top after
the manner of Royalty is now forwarded for
His Majestys insprection in order that he may
be satisfied as to the truth of this statement
Besides this they (the English) are again settling 
and residing in the Island of Kishm
and parties of them continually arriving remain 
in that place_ Should this thing therefore 
be neglected or passed over by the Gov.t
it may by degrees be the cause (which God
forbid) of detrement to the Kingdom_
This communication is intented
to be conveyed to the capital and delivered to
His Majesty by Aga Mohumed Kazim Koza

a present of 500 Tomans.

Sir,
Accounts have been this day received
of a decisive action between Rahma ben Jabir
and a Bahrein Buglow; in which the former
after an heroic defence, set fire to his magazine
and involved both Vessels in utter distruction_
The particulars of this desperate engagement
are variovsly related, but the followind details being
the result of a careful comparison of different written 
and verbal statements, may be considered as
the most authentic account of this interesting
event which has yet reached Bushire_
2
Rahma ben Jaber having by his violent
and unjust aggressions united the Shaiks of Bahrein
and Katiffe into a close alliance against him, sailed 
from Daman in a large and well appointed
Buglow to implore succour from his friends in
different parts of the Gulf, leaving his eldest Son
Bashire with a sufficient garrison to maintain
the Fort during his absence_ During his progress
in search of assistance Rahma touched at
Kishm and after fruitless attemps to engage
the Imam in his quarrel proceeded to Bushire,
where he remained some time and endeavoured
to prevail upon me to interpose in behalf


130
of his family, but finding him determined to persist 
in his exorbitant demand on Katiffe and
averse to making the slightest concessions for
the wanton indignaties with which he had
treated the subjects of Shaik Abdoolla ben Ahmed, 
I declined all further interference, and in
a few days afterwards he sailed for Daman -/-
breathing defiance against his enemies_ Altho
the harbour was blockaded by the Bahrein
fleet it appears that he subceeded in visiting
his garrison and returing safe on board his
Boat where he was received with a salute by
his followers_ This decisive indication of his
presence excited the instant attention of the
opposite party, one of whose Boats commanded 
by Shaik Ahmed ben Suleman, the Nephew 
of Shaik Abdoola, proceeded to attack
him_ A desperate struggle ensued till Shaik
Ahmed having lost nearly the whole of his
crew by the fire of Rahma's boat retired for
reenforcements_ These were speedily furnished
by the other Vessels of the Fleet which were directed 
by Shaik Ahmed to keep aloof from the
conflict while he returned after making this
chivubious arrangement to meet his brave antagonist_ 
The fight recommenced with fury, but Rahma 
perceiving that his people were rapidly falling
around him, mustered the remainder of the crewissued 
orders to grapple with his opponent and
after embracing his young son wasted with a
lighted torch to the Magazine, which immediately 
exploded, blowing his Buglow to atoms
and setting fire at the same time to the Bahrein
boat


131
boat which soon afterwards shared a similar
fate_ Shaik Ahmed and a few of his followers
fortunately effected his escape to the other boats
of the squadron but only one person was saved
out of Rahma's Buglow, and it is supposed that
in the course of the action 300 men must have
perished._
Bashire still held out in the Fort
of Daman, but it is impossible that he can long
withstand the Force that has been brought -/-
against him, destitute, as he now is, of all hope
of assistance, and deprived of the advantage of
that enthusiasm, which the undaunted spirit
of his Father had infused into all his followers
While Rahma lived the peace of the Gulf could
never be considered secure, and his restless unprincipled 
habits afforded a dangerous example 
to other unsettled characters, who under
pretence of a declaration of war against the
mercantile states might like him have evaded 
all responsibility and rivallled the enormties 
of their piratical predecessors till emboldened 
by success and impunity to interrupt our
trade and thus ultimately incur a long merited 
chastisement._ The Event which I have
had the honor to communicate in this Dispatch
has removed these apprehensions and encourages
the hope of a continuance of tranquillity._

Sir,
I had the honor to receive your letter
of the 1st. May inclosing amended Copies of
Journals for 1823/4 and 1824/5 for my signature
on the 1st. Septemr., when I was on the point of
embarking on a tour to the Arabian Coast and
I have thus been compelled to postpone my
reply till the present period, I have now the
pleasure to transmit Copies of the Books made
out in your Office which I have taken the liberty 
to substitute in lieu of the latter for the
following reasons._
Under the head of Marine charges
in the Cash account for the Quarter ending 30th.
April 1824, an advance of 35,836.3.04 appears
to have been made to Captain Sealy commanding
the H.C.C Ternate, which amount is confirmed
by a reference to the Duplicate receipt preserved
in this Office, altho the same payment is entered
in the corrected Journal as 35,203.2.08 only
It has therefore become necessary to deviate
in this instance from the Journal sent up
for my guidance and I beg leave to inclose the
duplicate


136
duplicate receipt above alluded to as a voucher 
for the accuracy of the original charge_
Two other errors appear to exist in the same
Journal as follows_ The first from an excess
of Bombay Rupees 20. in a Bill No.29 which
was sold by Captn. Hardy on the 28th. Novr. 1823.
and entered in the Cash account for that Month
as drawn for B'bay Rs. 3720_ This corresponds with
the sum in Persian Rs. stated in the corrected
Journal at the rate of 128 pr. 100 while the _._
amount of the Bill in Bombay Rs. is there
entered as 3740._ The second mistake has occurred 
in the amount of a Bill No.45. dated 29.
April 1824 which is stated in the corrected Journal 
at 9980 Bombay Rupees whereas appears
both from the Register and Quarterly Cash
Account for July 1824 to have been drawn for
10,000_ In the Copy herewith transmitted I
have accordingly rectified both these errors
and beg to refer you to the Registers of the
Bills and to the Cash Accounts for Novemr.
1823 and for the Quarter ending 31 July 1824.
for the purpose of the corrections._
The balance in the Books for 1823/4
being thus deminished by the sum of 633._. 96a
corresponding alteration was necessarily made
in those of 1824/25 and I have now the pleasure
to transmit originals and Duplicates for those
years agreeing in every other respect, with those
which were made out in your Office and forwarded 
for my signature which I trust will be approved 
of._

you may have occasion to make on this Treasury
to an equal amount
Bills for 6000 Bombay Rupees
have been already disposed of at the usual rate
of 129 pr. 100 and the remainder of the Bills on
that presidency can be speedily negociated on
the same terms, but those on Bengal are much
less in demand and the rise which I had anticipated 
in the exchange on that place has been
checked by late accounts from India, representing 
a considerable increase in the price of bullion 
which made the remittance in specie more
favorable than formerly_ Still there is every
probability that money will be readily procured
at 134 but I am rather inclined to wait till
the impression of our being in immediate want
of funds has subsided by which means I hope
to keep the exchange from falling below the
usual level._

Sir,
Under the apprehension that
representations calculated to excite feelings prejudicial 
to the good understanding which
subsists between the two Nations will be submitted 
to Tehran by the Government of Fars
it appears desirable that you should be furnished with all the information which I
have it in in my power to afford, on this subject
and I therefore beg leave to transmit for your
Vide Page notice Copies and Translations of communications
118 to lately received from Shiraz, together with
Page 128.
Copy of a letter addressed by me to the Chief
Secretary to the Government of Bombay on
the receipt of these documents._
You will perceive that Zekee
Khan affects to interpret an expression in my
letter to the Prince as conveying a disrespectful
insinuation against His Persian Majesty, but
I trust it is scarcely necessary for me to disclaim 
any such intention._ My object was
simply to manifest in the clearest point of view 
my inability to dictate to the Imam of
Muscat, the line of conduct which the Shiraz
Authorities appeared to be anxious that he
should adopt regarding his differences with
the Shaik of Bushire; and thus to put an effectual 
stop to all further solicitations on that subject_ 
I had already, on so many occasions disavowed 
all authority over the Imam and so
repeatedly represented the impossibility of my
exciting


or


145
exist respecting the real object of our connexion
with it, and it is still more difficult to conceive 
that the utility of our Marine Establishment 
in the Gulf can be called in question
by the Shiraz Government, whose maritime
subjects now experience a security in their
property and trade which was altogether unknown 
previous to the adoption of the present 
system_ It is evidently therefore both
unfriendly and inconsistent in Zekee Khan
to start any doubts regarding our Marine
post at Bassidore or to embarrass an arrangement 
which has been productive of
such essential benefit to the revenue and
country under his administration and I
should hope that these considerations alone
would induce the Persian Government to withhold 
its sanction from any proposal that
may be submitted to it from Shiraz for this
purpose._
You will regret to find that the
directions conveyed in the Royal Firman
respecting the restitution of the property
wrecked on the Coast of Dashtee is still
evaded under various pretences which are
enumerated in Zekee Khan's letter and adverted 
to in my dispatch to the Chief
Secretary_ These documents together with
the communications which I had formerly
the honor to make to you on the same
subject will put you in full possession
of all the circumstances of the case, but in
order to remove every obstacle towards the
re=


144

had property on board his Buglow I now beg
Videred to enclose a detailed statement of the which
lace of the Articles plundered on that occasion

We have been gratified by the arrival

On the 29th. Ol. the Shanmen arrived and cant

Anchor off the Creck of Bussorah_ soon atter
the second Peace your communication dated
the 9th. Ultimo arrived in a Buteel and delighed 
us by the information of your continued
good health_ Let it not be concoaled from
your Highness that Peace has been establisher
thro the mediation of the Resident but not
before the country had been reduced to the
last extremity by the sons of Hummood on
the land side and by us from the liver as we
informed you before by the Butel_ Three
ships belonging to the Enemy fell in to our hand
on the Bagdad side, as they were firingupthe 
Party of Shaik Mayid near the rever then
we had done this the Inhabitants of Bussora
had no other resource left but to Cast themsion
upon the Resident and Pace was at last concluded 
upon conditions that the fixed trilse
for the three last years amounting to 3000.
mans currency should be paid and the Merchants 
claim settled_ The Resident was so
urgent upon us and disturbed as to say that two
thirds of Bussorah belonged to the Company as
all the Christions and rew were connected with
the greatest part of their Servants of that body
he also engaged that the money should be delivered 
in the course of three days and became
security in the affair of Shaik Salim giving a
Paper to the effect that should the claim belonfully
established and the Defendant unable
to pay the amount to the Resident would be
answerable for it and should it not be satisfactorily 
proved and the Defendant deny it
he


47
should then take the gaths by the Qoor an
upon these conditions peace
and Tullay
was established_ If We wished to represent
to your Highness the state of affairs in Bussorah
and what we witnessed of the two parties of that place
and the that the writer would be fatigued and
the Paper insufficient most likely Shaik Salim
will make you acquainted with some portion_
after three days we intend Godewilling to proceed
to Mohuma before the Water diminishes towards
the end of the month_ This is our intention and
God willing we shall lay before you all further
particulars in your own presence and assemby
Bussorah is now besiged by the Sons of Hummud 
and the people of that who are with
them as they were with us, and if they had spoken 
the truth that City had been distroyed_ The
arrival of your Highness Vessel at Bussorah has
been of great advantage to the Inhabitants of the
Chal and the Resident as we have ascertained
that lately owing to the pride of the Nedies their
power in Bussorah and the Control they have
over the Mootesellim no one spoke to the Resident
Now however his dignity has become very great, as
the People of the City, entreated him to use his
mediation for the rising_ the seige they being
reduced to the last extrewity_ accordingly the
Resident went to the obabies to get them to put a

to the Southward of Bussorah, a Chat Salival
joined as having only he sailors on board, and
afterwars

afterwards Shaik Mooladin and Shaik and
arrived in Boats and pitched their tents belon
the leet._ The caurse of the Peace being broken
originated with the People of Bussorah in the
following instance. Shaik sussal had several 
Boats laden with dates anchored close
by res for the purpose of eventually proceeding
to thentlace of Residence one of the conditions
of the Peace was that no molestation should
be offered to the Boats belonging to the above
Shaik, nor to the Inhabitants of Bool thusue
and Muhejeran places to the south of Bussorah 
subject to Humood, provided they should
leave of fighting against Bussorah and
the song of Hummud should depart to their
own Country_ These were the terms on which
the peace was fixed by the mediation of the
Resident_ The Turkish ships which were
on the Bagdad side near the Fents of Shaik
Mayed and about wice the distance of Gun
shot from us made safe after these Boats
and opened a fire of Cannon musquity and
Trape upon them._ We had desired them proviously 
not to go on in advance, but to allow
the Munsoorty to proceed first and then to
make sail_ From the want of ill however
before that ship could weigh anchor their
sails were filled and the wind blowing fred
from the southward and the tide also in forvor 
they went on a head and met with what
they did _ The whole of them however escaped with the exception of 3 Boats containing
only the sailors with their families which wer
taken

taken by the Bussorah Ships_ When the Monsoory 
got abreast of the wish Vessels she
fired Guns upon which they surrendered will
out returning a Musquet Shot_ soon afterwards
two mediatiors from the Merchants named Ben
Joomal and Ahmed bin Zahir with others, accompanying 
the Resident People came on board
and Solemnly swore that they had received the
written permission of the Mootesellim addrested
to the Commanders of the Turkish Vessels for
Shaik Gulsals Boats the day before but that
they had not been aware that the Boats in
question were to sail that day we however
returned them no answer but proceeded with
the remainder of the Fleet nearer Shaik Mayed
and remained there one right Shaik Majid
himself made an attack on one side of the
Country which would have succeeded but for the 
Heachery of his People_ The Residenthose
then came to us unattended single individual 
of the Bussorah Merchants._ They were four
of his confidential Dependants and informed
us that they had been sent by him to say
such was the state of Bussorah that if we
remained a single night longer it would be
ruined let gone and this would be thro the
man, that he could not permit us to do this
and that if we did not act agreeably to his
words we must give him a paper under
our hands stating that he had advised us
but that we had paid no attention to him
adding then it would be necessary for us
to go to war with the English._ Thly the InJabir

We have established peace in the manner before 
mentioned_ The new of Humood and the

I have been much gratified by
the receipt of your Highness letter conveying
the pleasing intelligence of the satisfactory
cermination of your disputes with Bussora
together with the full adrustment of your
claims upon that City and I take advantay
of the present opportunity to offer my sincerest 
congratulation on so happy an occusion, 
and at the same time to return my to
thanks for the perusal of the enclosed letter
from the Commanders of your Highness ent
when of Bussorah giving a detailed account
of their operations against that place_ There
are however several expressions in that communication 
ascribed to Captain Taylor the
Resident at Bussorah which I feel perfectly 
convinced in my own mind were eithergressly 
misrepresented to the Commanders of
Your Highness Vessels by the individuals who

and Mohumed ben Suliman have unfortunately 
misunderstood the purport of the missage 
sent by that Gentleman to whom I have
written in order that he may be ready to afford
any explanation of the Passages alluded to that
may be required by Government_ Under any circumstances 
however I am particularly anxious
to impress on your Highness that the British
Government would consider it but a poor return 
for the friendly disposition which you
have always manifested towards them._ were
they to assure the right of interfering in your
Highness arrangements and plans and to
assure you that their letters iniformly depecate
the rela of controting your rights as a Govereign and
independant Prince conciding entirely with the
tangage imariably held by me to your Highness
whether by correspondence or personal communication 
on the same subject._

133
To,
The Officer Commanding the Marine Baly
Bombay
Sir,
I have the honor to inform you
that in consequence of the unsubordiate and refractory 
conduct of Hossein Mahomed and Jehangeer 
Khan tive Privates belonging to the Marine 
Battation Native Infantry under your
Command and attached to the Escort of this
Residency I have been under the necessity of sending 
them on board the H.C.C. Clive and receiving
two Sepoys by name Shaik Moideen and Hose
Khan from the detachment of the Marine
Battation serving on board that Vessel in the
room of the above two Individuals with whose
conduct I have frequently had reason to be dissatisfied._
The particular instance which
rendered it incumbent on me to remove the Seapays 
in question from the Residency Guard and
which took place about two months ago during
my absence from Bushire was Hossen Mahomed
using the most gress and insulting lanquage
to Subidar Shaik Moideen who commands the
Detachment on his sending for him from his
quarters to inquire whether he was able to do
on duty, as he had been in the sick list for a
considerable time_ In this outrageons and
violent conduct he was yoined and abetted
by Jehangeer Khen and at last they came to
such length that the Subadar was obliged to
place them both in confinement a short time
afterwards on Bagnaik Ramnack the Naigue
of the Guard attempting to interfere between
possein


104
Ressin Mohumed and a man he was quarreling
with he was knocked down and repeatedly -/-
struck, by the former Individual._
Not having the power of inflicting
a punishment adequate to the riotous and
violent behabour of these two Sepoys I considered 
most advisable to adopt the measures
above narrated and in enclosing Copy of a
Veir letter to Captr. Betham Commander of the re=
93
Clive on the subject of their Transfer with his
reply thereto for your information
I have &amp;ca, &amp;ca;
