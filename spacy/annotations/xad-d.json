Your refusal of paying double Rent to Shaikh Nassirs Nacheel for the rent of our Factory at Bussora and referring the dispute to Mr Skipp in order for him to settle with Shaikh Nassir at Schirass concerning it, we think it the most proper method you could take for its adjustment.

Henry Moore To Mr James Morley Resident at Bushire- Sir I was favoured with your letter of the 12th Instant with the several papers therein mentioned agreable to your desire endeavour to settle the Rent of the Caravansera with Shaik Nassir, and procure a writing from him, that no more than the Sum stipulated shall be annualy demanded, the reason it was not settled last year agreable to the then Resident desire, was, that as the Embassy was not attended with the Success the Agent and Council were satisfied with, and from there orders. I had the greatest reason to conclude the factory would be entirely withdrawn, it therefore rendered it needless to stir in the affair .. Th enclosed Packet for the Agent and Council opportunity please to forward by the first I am Schirass - Sir - 21st March 1768 Your most humble Servant Recd the 29th D following George Shipp To Mr James Morley Resident at Bushire Sir The Dolphin Schooner arrived you our last letter under date the 17th Instant and this we dispatch to you by a small Bushire Boat, purposely to inclose you a letter to the Plenipotentiury at Schiras, and to inform you, that , 21 21 that, Under the 23 instant the Turks seized eleven Trankeys and other boats belonging to Meer Mahanna, which the Meer had sent up with Merchandized to Bussora, and which were to return with Provisions to Carrack, a say before the Turks permitted to seize these Vessels, the Bombay Grab, Targer and Wolf were despatched to the Bar under pretence of looking out for our expected Shipping, but in reality to seize on five of the Meers Gallivals which we had intelligence were laying at the mouth of the river and which we intended detaining untill the Meer had given us proper satisfaction for some insults very lately shown to our pass and Colours-the Gallivals however quitted their station under the 20th Instant and our Cruizers are now returned to the hassar There is no doubt to be made but the Meer has by this time intelligence of the forces we expect from Bombay of the seizure of his trankeys by the Turks, and the blow we meditated against him, this supposed, he will undoubtely endeavour to revenge himself by the Capture of such of our Vessel as are not of force sufficient to resist him and we are at present under no small fears should the Dolphin leave Bushire above, but that she may be taken by some or other of his Gallivals- to prevent therefore as much as possible the ill effects that may accrue from the Meers resentment, we would have you caution the Commanders of all Vessels bound up the Gulph, to be well upon their guard: We are much concerned that the tedious passage of the Eagle Fancy and Success prevents our sending a fleet of observation off Carrack, should they not have left Bushire before this Letter gets down to you, let not a moments time be lost in forwarding them further as they will not be detained, any longer here, than to land their Consignments tranship their stores, and make such removes as the orders of our Superiors may render necessary - We would have you immediately forward the accompanying packet to Mr Skipp at Schiras, and are Sir Bussora Your Loving Friends the 26th.
