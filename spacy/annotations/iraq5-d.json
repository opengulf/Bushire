Thus it happens that enumerations of tribal subdivisions received at different times or from different sources seldom tally, and that the Turkish Government do not understand, and that the tribesmen themselves are often unable to explain, the relationship subsisting between different sections. As concrete examples of the uncertainties encountered we may mention that diverse accounts represent the Dafāfi'ah and the Āl Bū Darrāj as wholly independent tribes and as sections of the Shammar Tōqah and Banī Lām respectively; that the Sarāi Arabs figure in some statements as a subdivision of the Bani Lām and in others as a section of the Banī Rabī' ah; and that the Khasraj are sometimes named in connection either with the Bani Lām or with the Zubaid, and at other times are spoken of as a tribe by themselves. The fluidity of tribal conditions is illustrated by the fact that the BaniMālīk, Ahl-al-Jazāir and Bani Mansūr, who a few years back were apparently considered to be sections of the Muntafik, are now generally regarded as possessing each a separate existence. Part of the confusion arises from a tendency to class a small tribe which depends upon the assistance of a larger tribe in war as a section of the larger; and the political alliances which thus partly determine classification are unstable and fluctuating. Doubts of the kind we have indicated could be finally settled only by elaborate local enquiries among the tribes. In the present Gazetteer we have been guided by the best opinions available; but accuracy, in the circumstances, cannot be guaranteed.8",{"entities":[[21,26,"GPE"],[143,156,"TRIBE"],[190,195,"GPE"],[217,225,"TRIBE"],[229,244,"LOC"],[383,401,"ORG"],[645,654,"TRIBE"],[663,675,"TRIBE"],[728,741,"TRIBE"],[746,754,"TRIBE"],[778,789,"TRIBE"],[840,848,"TRIBE"],[883,896,"TRIBE"],[911,918,"TRIBE"],[969,977,"TRIBE"],[990,996,"TRIBE"],[1128,1137,"TRIBE"],[1139,1152,"TRIBE"],[1157,1168,"TRIBE"],[1240,1248,"TRIBE"]]}],["",{"entities":[]}],["Two stringent articles of the tribal code are those relating to protection and assistance: under the first a person on whose protection another expressly throws himself must receive him into his house and refuse to surrender him even at the cost of his own life; under the second a guest who, after declining proffered food and coffee, is addressed with the phrase \" Eat, thy demand shall be satisfied \" is entitled to the utmost assistance of his entertainer in the design which he may thereupon unfold. An important feature of the tribal system is the payment of Dīyah ديّه or blood-money for murders, a matter which the Turkish Government has so far been content to leave in the hands of the Shaikhs. The ordinary price of a man's life ranges from 100 to 1000 Bashliks, say £4 to £40 (English); but among the Muntafik it is £37, among the BaniMālik £60, and among the Khazā 'il is said to rise to as much as 1000 Majīdīs or about £170. The value of a woman is generally the same as that of a man, but sometimes it is half; the Dīyah of a Saiyid is double that of an ordinary person. If the victim and the murderer belong to different tribes the relations of the victim receive ½ the blood-money, the Shaikhs of his tribe take 1/6, and the remaining 1/3 is divided among his fellow tribesmen at large. Money compensation may be declined, and the heir of a murdered man may demand instead two unmarried girls of his own selection from the murderer's tribe; on their being made over to him the claim to pecuniary compensation is transferred from him to the girls' next-of-kin. For a woman received in marriage a sum of 100 to 1000 Bashliks, called Mihr مهر, is paid to her father or next-of-kin; the bride is carried in procession to the house of the bridegroom with jumping, singing, dancing and firing of guns, —a display known as Hōsah هوسه; on the next day one of the relatives of the bridegroom spreads a cloth on the ground and exclaims \" Shōbāsh \", whereupon the guests come forward with their wedding presents. Strange to say the same performance of Hōsah attends the conveyance of a corpse to burial; the Fātihah is then read and mourning continues for from three to five days: the mourners are treated as guests, but they bring with them money or other presents. A pilgrim returned from Makkah holds a reception tor three days; his visitors also are his guests, and they too offer gifts.",{"entities":[[621,639,"ORG"],[693,701,"TITLE"],[749,769,"MONEY"],[775,777,"MONEY"],[781,784,"MONEY"],[810,818,"TRIBE"],[825,828,"MONEY"],[840,849,"TRIBE"],[850,853,"MONEY"],[869,878,"TRIBE"],[909,921,"MONEY"],[931,936,"MONEY"],[1178,1195,"QUANTITY"],[1227,1230,"QUANTITY"],[1250,1253,"QUANTITY"],[1617,1637,"MONEY"],[2163,2181,"QUANTITY"],[2293,2299,"GPE"],[2322,2332,"QUANTITY"]]}],["",{"entities":[]}]]}
