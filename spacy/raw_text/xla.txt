The Officer Commanding the Marine Battn.
Bombay
Sir,
I have the honor to inform you
that in consequence of the unsubordinate and re=
=fractory conduct of Hossein Mahomed and Je=
=hangeer Khan two Privates belonging to the Ma=
=rine Battalion Native Infantry under your
Command and attached to the Escort of this
Residency I have been under the necessity of send=
=ing them on board the H.C.C. Clive and receiving
two Seapoys by name Shaik Moideen and Hossen
Khan from the detachment of the Marine
Battalion serving on board that Vessel in the
room of the above two Individuals with whose
conduct I have frequently had reason to be dis=
=satisfied._
The particular instance which
rendered it incumbent on me to remove the Sea=
=poys in question from the Residency Guard and
which took place about two months ago during
my absence from Bushire was Hossen Mahomed
using the most gross and insulting language
to Subidar, Shaik Moideen who commands the
Detachment on his sending for him from his
quarters to inquire whether he was able to go-
on duty, as he had been in the sick list for a
considerable time_ In this outrageous and
violent conduct he was joined and abetted
by Jehangeer Khan and at last they came to
such length that the Subadar was obliged to
place them both in confinement a short time
afterwards on Bagnack Ramnack the Naique
of the Guard attempting to interfere between
Hossein


104
Hossin Mohumed and a man he was quarreling
with he was knocked down and repeatedly -/-
struck by the former Individual._
Not having the power of inflicting
a punishment adequate to the riotous and
violent behabiour of these two Sepoys I consi=
=dered most advisable to adopt the measures
above narrated and in enclosing Copy of a
Vide Page letter to Captn. Betham Commander of the -/-
95
Clive on the subject of their Transfer with his
reply thereto for your information
I have &ca, &ca;
Bushire Resy.
