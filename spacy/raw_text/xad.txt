Shouts two or more of the Honble Companys
cruizers, designed for this place, arrive at Bushire, you will immediately dispatch the
smallest of them hither, with any advices they may being from the Residency- the 
others you will keep with you untill further orders..
Provided the Merchants will come into your
proposal of taking off BroadCloth, when they are only in want of Serpets, it will
doubtless be a very beneficial measure to the Honble Company: were we the only
dealars in Cloth in the Persian Dominions, this, might succeed, but in the present
situation of affairs we fear it will not; we direct you however to attempt it, in
case you are suceessful to continue it; we have already sent you our resolutions
on the subject of not ordering any woollens from Bushire to Bussora
