Bushier you did cause her to proceed without delay to the Bar of Bussora River thence
to dispatch one of the boats to maghiel with the Packets for Me & for the Resident at
Bagdad under the charge of a Lieutenant or Midshipman and having effected that
Service to return expeditiously to his Station under Your Orders, Such an arrangement
would probably have secured the receipt by Me of those Packets on or before the 25 Ultimo
and it could not have exposed either yourself or Mr Bruce or the Honble Companys
Property under your Charge to any possible Risk as it would have depended totally on
Your own will and Pesidence whether the truly unfortunate event which occasioned the
Ternates voyage from the Presidency to the Gulph became known or remained
a Secret at Bushire untill her Return to you
On the Receipt if your letter beforementioned of the 21Ultimo
I formed an intention of immeadately dispatching the Panther to Bushire in order
that in Compliance with your wishes and Requests She might afford an digible


31
Conveyance hither for the Packets on board the Ternate, on more serious
however I was induced to hesitate on the adoption of that measure on a Recollection that
My Vessel the Recovery which ought to have left Bombay about the 15th. July and even
the August Mail vessel must according to all reasonable Chances and Calculation
have reached Bushire before the expiration of last month and by a conrition that
You would have taken requisite advantage of their Importation there to secure by
one of them the transmission to me of the Packets inquestion and in the very moment
of my being overpaid informing a decision on the Subject I received advices from
Europe and Constantinople rendering necessary the dispatch of a vessel to India and
the present Departure of the Panther on her returning
Voyage to Bombay
The Panther wilt touch at Bushir for the express purpose of
receiving your advices for the Honble the President in Council who will no doubt be extremly
anxious to receive intelligence from you of the safe arrival at Bushier of the Ternate and
of the probable immeadate consequences in Persia of the melencholy fate of the tate Hadgee
Kullul Khawn
you will
I request however expedite the Departure from Bushire for the Presidency
of the Panther as much as may be possible, and Itake upon Myself the Responsibitity of
strongly recommending to you to retain the Ternate at Bushire untill replies to Your
Communications to the Court of Tehran unequivocally convince you that the accident
which deprived the late Persian Embassador of life will not expose the Honble Companys
Servants, Property and Credit at Bushirer to Risk and Danger
Most sincerely do I lament the accident in
question for however unavoidable it may have been it is to be feard that the Persian
Monarch, ignorant of the Honble Correctness of the British Government in India may
idly attribute it to Design or to a want of requisite arrangements at the Presidency for
the Secunity and Protection of his Representations
I have hitherto concealed the Death of Hadgee Khullul
Khawn from the knowledge of every Person here except that of WDay, but as it is a
circumstance which must necessarily be discoverd at a very early period I suggest to you
the Propriety of explaining it to the Deacaseds Agents and Relation, Aga Mahomed Nebie
by which Conduct you may extend his means of receiving the Khawns Property in
Persia and of preventing Injury to the Fortune and Family of a Person who in his life
time rendered some essential Services to the British Nation thereby establishing claim
on its liberalety and on its Capability of affording all possible Assistance and Comfort
under their afflection & Misfortunes to his securing Childeren, Wives and Dependents
I have the honor to be
Sir
Maghil 6th. October
Your very obedient humble Servant
