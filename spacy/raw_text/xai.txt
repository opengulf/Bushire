this Extraordinary zeal- had Mr Skipp favoured us with a Copy of his letter to
to the governor and Council, we might perhaps have been convinced of the necessity 
of the dispatch; but as it is, we must own it has somewhat surprised us-

her overtaking the Betsey ketch before her arrival at or departure from Bushire-On

Resident
at Bushire-
Sir
I was favoured with your letter of the 12th Instant
with the several papers therein mentioned agreable to your desire endeavour to
settle the Rent of the Caravansera with Shaik Nassir, and procure a writing from
him, that no more than the Sum stipulated shall be annualy demanded, the
reason it was not settled last year agreable to the then Resident desire, was, that 
as the Embassy was not attended with the Success the Agent and Council were 
satisfied with, and from there orders. I had the greatest reason to conclude the
factory would be entirely withdrawn, it therefore rendered it needless to stir in
the affair ..
