Honble Sir_
I had the Honor to inform your Honble Board sometime ago that Europe Clothes of a Pea
Green Colour was not saleable at the Market In the year 1800 several of that came here which
was sent back to the Presidency as there was no prospect of them being sold_
By the Goods received by the Ships Diamond & Governor Duncan several Bales of
Clothes of that Colour came here by mistake Amongst the Bales of Scarlet Long Ells as marked
in the Invoice, three of them proved to be Pea Green- two of them was along with the
damaged Goods & one along with several Bales of Scarlet Long Ells sold & carried to Yedz
Also when I sold the Broad Cloth the Bales where all spend; amongst which in leu of Scarlet
Superfine; three Bales of Fine Pea Green where found- I cannot say whether this mistake
originated in packing the Bales at Europe  or in Shipping them at Bombay_  but as 
I sold the Goods for Scarlet Colours & the Brown Cloth for Superfine; I have to request  your
Honble Board will direct the Invoice to be forwarded that I may be able to settle their proper
price with the Merchants If any more Bales of Pea Green should be found amongst
the Bales of Long Ells now here, I shall acquaint your Honble Board of it
I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated the 9th.
April 1802 & agreeable to it respecting Mr Waring I have fully followed- I wrote to the
Governor of Sheraze & Isphahawn informing them that a European Gentlemen
was coming up the Country & requested that they would direct that He might not
be molested on his tour; I also wrote to the Shaike Nassur Khawn Governor of Bushier
as He was then at Sheraze_
Colonel Harcourt in Charge of a Packet for Europe from the Most
Noble the Governor General arrived here on the 4th June & left this again on  


the 7th. He directed that I work and send on Europe in five days by land to Bussora
to inform Mr. Manesty of his being on his way there with which I of course complied
The Political situation of this Country is very serious at present by Sea no
trafic is carried on but in English Ships as the Country Vessels dare not venture out of
there Parts for  of the Baniattaba Arabs_ By land the whole of the Country is in disturbances
indeed the Caravans from here to Sheraze are frequently plundered, which is never the case
when the King is feared-
I have the honor to forward three Months Accounts of this Factory
