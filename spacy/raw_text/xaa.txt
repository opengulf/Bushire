Mr. James Morley
Resident
Bushire
Sir
Since our last letter to you of the 9 Novemb
by the Dolphin Schooner, your express boat is arrived with your original letters of 
8th and 9th Instant, and a Duplicate of the 24 of October; original of which, has since
been received, We have also received your General Books.
It is not in our power at present to do anyÂ¬
thing in the disputes between Carim Caun and the Shaikhs of Boushire and Bah
writing to him just now, we do not imagine would have the least good effect; if 
are ordered by our Superiors to enter into fresh negociations with the Caun, Bush
of course will not be neglected, and untill then, we shall avoid interfering in their
any further than what is immediately relative to our own Factory and comme
We hope your fears on account the Honble
Companys property being plundered in case of an attack at Bushire by the persians
prove groundless. You will know our Cruizers are otherwise employed: when the
Ormuso expedition is over, should we think it necessary, we will station acco
Cruizers at Bushire, as you now seem to think their presence is absolutely nec
for the preservation of the Honble Companys effects: there is no probability
beginning before Shaik Ice his return from Bahreen, which we do not imagine
will be, before our Cruizers return from Ormuso.
In our letter by the Dolphin we have
to you what is proper regarding your sending us the Woollens we have indented for.
Your supplying the managers on the Ormuse
Expedition with money and a few peices of Woollens was very proper.
Whatever money the Honble Company
be indebted to Mr Bonnyear, he has only to draw bills on this Ag for there
of it, should not the Cash we have already remitted you
pay the amount borrowed of him.
We are informed that


account of the sad Catrastrophe; never think about the expense, when so much depends on
the early arrival of intelligence at Bombay; to have had an account of the loss received by
our Superiors before their Cruizers may have sailed for the Gulph, might have been of the 
utmost consequences-
To convey this melancholy intelligence
we now dispatch the Salamander to Bombay; Lieutenant Gages stay at Bushire is
limited to four and twenty hours; on no account therefore detain him longer than that
time, but as much short of it as possible, we make no doubt but your dispatch for
India are all ready, as you must conclude we should dispatch there as soon after
the Salamanders arrival at Bussora as possible.
We should have you examine Mr Bowye
Papers for a Will: if you find one of course you will act in compliance thereto: but
if he has died intestate let his perishables be sold, the remainder sealed up, and make
application to Bombay for further directions in this manner we act regarding
Mr Lyster who has died intestate.
It is improper that Bushire should
be without two covenanted servants, we have appointed Mr. John Yoakly Botham
Wuter to your assistance, who has received his Salary to the 1 of July last and 
dietmoney to the 31st. of this month_
We are very much pleased that the Persian
troops are withdrawn from the Country about Bushire, and hope that your Shaikhs
arrival at Schiras will take off every impedement that our trade has long laboured
under;- we are very much in want of Cash, and shall be very glad when the
State of your Treasury will admit of your consigning us any; when it will, take 
the first secure conveyance for doing it
We again recommend the shortest detention
possible of the Salamander, and are
